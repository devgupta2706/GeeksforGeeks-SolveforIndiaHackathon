    <h4>About Rice</h4>
    <p>Oryza Sativa, it is believed, is associated with wet, humid climate, though it is not a tropical plant. It is probably a descendent of wild grass that was most likely cultivated in the foothills of the far Eastern Himalayas. Another school of thought believes that the rice plant may have originated in southern India, then spread to the north of the country and then onwards to China. It then arrived in Korea, the Philippines (about 2000 B. C.) and then Japan and Indonesia (about 1000 B. C.).The journey of rice around the world has been slow, but once it took root it stayed and became a major agriculture and economic product for the people. In the Indian subcontinent more than a quarter of the cultivated land is given to rice (20011-12). It is a very essential part of the daily meal in the southern and eastern parts of India. In the northern and central parts of the subcontinent, where wheat is frequently eaten, rice holds its own and is cooked daily as well as on festivals and special occasions.</p>
    <h4>History of Rice in India</h4>
    <p>India is an important centre of rice cultivation. The rice is cultivated on the largest areas in India. Historians believe that while the indica variety of rice was first domesticated in the area covering the foothills of the Eastern Himalayas (i.e. north-eastern India), stretching through Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Southern China, the japonica variety was domesticated from wild rice in southern China which was introduced to India. Perennial wild rice still grow in Assam and Nepal. It seems to have appeared around 1400 BC in southern India after its domestication in the northern plains. It then spread to all the fertile alluvial plains watered by rivers. Some says that the word rice is derived from the Tamil word arisi.</p>
    <h4>Climatic Requirements</h4>
    <p>In India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate. Rice cultivation in India extends from 8 to35ยบN latitude and from sea level to as high as 3000 meters. Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which have high humidity, prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of water. The average temperature required throughout the life period of the crop ranges from 21 to 37ยบ C. Maximum temp which the crop can tolerate 400C to 42 0C.</p>
    <h4>Rainfalls Requirements</h4>
    <p>Rice is a water-loving crop, and therefore, it requires a significant amount of rainfall or irrigation for optimal growth and yield. However, the exact rainfall requirements for rice can vary depending on the rice variety, soil type, and other environmental factors.
    Generally, rice requires an average rainfall of about 1000-1500 mm per annum, distributed over the growing season, which typically lasts for 120-150 days. However, the critical period for rainfall is during the vegetative and reproductive stages of rice growth.
    During the vegetative stage (the first 40-60 days after planting), rice requires a steady supply of water to establish its root system and produce healthy leaves. During the reproductive stage (60-100 days after planting), rice requires sufficient water to support the development of the panicles and fill the grains.
    It's important to note that excess rainfall or waterlogging can also harm the rice crop by reducing soil oxygen levels and promoting the growth of diseases. Therefore, proper management of water through irrigation or drainage is crucial to ensure healthy rice growth and yield.</p>
    <h4>Nutritional value of Rice</h4>
    <p>Rice is a nutritional staple food which provides instant energy as its most important component is carbohydrate (starch). On the other hand, rice is poor in nitrogenous substances with average composition of these substances being only 8 per cent and fat content or lipids only negligible, i.e., 1per cent and due to this reason it is considered as a complete food for eating. Rice flour is rich in starch and is used for making various food materials. It is also used in some instances by brewers to make alcoholic malt. Likewise, rice straw mixed with other materials is used to produce porcelain, glass and pottery. Rice is also used in manufacturing of paper pulp and livestock bedding.The variability of composition and characteristics of rice is really broad and depends on variety and environmental conditions under which the crop is grown. In husked rice, protein content ranges in between 7per cent to 12per cent. The use of nitrogen fertilizers increases the percentage content of some amino acids.</p>
    <h4>Medicinal Value</h4>
    <p>The immense diversity of rice germplasm is a rich source for many rice based products and is also used for treating many health related maladies such as indigestion, diabetes, arthritis, paralysis, epilepsy and give strength to pregnant and lactating mothers. Ancient Ayurvedic literature testify the medicinal and curative properties of different types of rice grown in India. Medicinal rice varieties like Kanthi Banko (Chhattisgarh), Meher, Saraiphul & Danwar (Orissa), Atikaya & Kari Bhatta (Karnataka), are very common in India. Few varieties cultivated in restricted pockets of Kerala for their medical properties e.g. Chennellu, Kunjinellu, Erumakkari & Karuthachembavu etc</p>

    <h4>Crop Production Practices</h4>
    <p>In India Rice is mainly grown in two types of soils i.e., (i) uplands and (ii) low lands. The method of cultivation of rice in a particular region depends largely on factors such as situation of land, type of soils, irrigation facilities, availability of labourers intensity and distribution of rainfalls. The crop of rice is grown with the following methods
        Dry or Semi-dry upland cultivation
        Broadcasting the seedSowing the seed behind the plough or drillingWet or lowland cultivation
        Transplanting in puddled fields.Broadcasting sprouted seeds in puddled fields</p>
    <h4>Selection of Seeds</h4>
    <p>The use of quality seeds in cultivation of rice is an important factor to get better crop yield. Therefore, proper care has to be taken in selecting seeds of the best quality. Much of the success in raising the healthy seedlings depends on the quality of seed. Seeds intended for sowing should satisfy the following requirements
        The seed should belong to the proper variety, which is proposed to be grown.The seed should be clean and free from obvious mixtures of other seeds.The seed should be mature, well developed and plump in size.The seed should be free from obvious signs of age or bad storage.The seed should have a high germinating capacity.Before sowing the seed should be treated with fungicides which protects the seed against soil-born fungi and also give a boost to the seedlings.</p>

    <h4>Field Prepration</h4>
    <p>Proper field preparation is crucial for successful rice cultivation. Here are the steps to prepare the field before seeding rice:

        Land Clearing: The first step is to clear the field of any debris, rocks, and weeds. This can be done using a plow, disc harrow, or cultivator.
        
        Leveling: Leveling the field is essential to ensure uniform distribution of water during irrigation. Use a leveler or laser-guided equipment to achieve a smooth and even surface.
        
        Soil Preparation: Rice requires a well-prepared soil that is rich in nutrients and has good water-holding capacity. Use a rotavator, harrow, or cultivator to break up the soil and prepare a seedbed that is fine and loose.
        
        Irrigation: Before seeding, irrigate the field thoroughly to ensure that the soil is moist and the water is evenly distributed.
        
        Seed Selection and Treatment: Select high-quality rice seeds that are disease-free and adapted to the local growing conditions. Treat the seeds with a fungicide or insecticide to prevent seed-borne diseases and pests.
        
        Seeding: Use a seed drill or broadcast method to sow the seeds evenly on the prepared seedbed. The recommended seeding rate is typically 100-120 kg/ha.
        
        Post-seeding Irrigation: Immediately after seeding, irrigate the field again to ensure that the soil is adequately moist and the seeds have good contact with the soil.</p>
